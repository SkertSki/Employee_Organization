# Employee Organization

## DESCRIPTION

  

  

  

  This project was motivated by the desire to create an interactive and somewhat complex menu system for navigating a SQL database

  This project stands out from the attention to detail and the ideas it touches upon as far as a more complex project could go 

   

  If I were to add anything to this in the future. I would implement this with an actual data base and a front end
