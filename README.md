# Employee Organization

## DESCRIPTION

  

  ****** This project is purely educational and is not intended for use ******

  

  This project was motivated by the desire to create an interactive and somewhat complex menu system for navigating a SQL database.


   

  If I were to add anything to this in the future. I would implement this with an actual data base and add a front end.
